      <p class="text-justify">An “INFLUENCER” is today defined as anyone with a large social media following and the ability to 'influence' their followers. Gone is the era when only celebrities were once called influencers. Even if celebrities continue to play a role, a 'influencer' A celebrity's post may reach a big number of people, but they may or may not be interested in your company. Influencers that share your values and exemplify your brand can be more useful to work with because it's better to reach a smaller group of individuals who are more inclined to buy your goods or engage with your brand than thousands of people who don't.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">
      In today’s time if you want to establish your brand presence among the audience then Influencer marketing is an extremely valuable strategy to incorporate it allows you to reach a specific, engaged audience while also expanding your brand's reach. Here are a few reasons why influencer marketing should be incorporated into your marketing strategy:
</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Important for brand recognition</h6>
      <p class="text-justify">Influencers with significant followings have a lot of power to spread brand awareness by reaching a large number of individuals with a single post. If their followers are genuine and have a high engagement rate, recommendations and goods they write about are likely to be recognized and considered by them. Collaborations with influencers can help brands stand out and attract new followers, allowing them to achieve greater awareness and traction. Influencer marketing is used by brands for a variety of reasons, and each influencer campaign should have its own set of objectives. Influencer marketing is used by 37 percent of respondents in a new study by Influencer Marketing Hub to enhance brand recognition, making it the most popular method.</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Right to each your target audience</h6>
      <p class="text-justify">Every marketing strategy must begin with identifying and reaching out to your target demographic. Influencer marketing is a fantastic approach to reach out to your target audience; just make sure you do your homework first. Check to see whether they're relevant to your brand, if they have 'real' followers from your target demographic, and if their image matches yours. Choosing an influencer with a target audience helps your campaign/message/product to be noticed by people who are likely to be interested in what you have to offer and engage with you – which is, of course, the ultimate goal of influencer marketing.</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Increases Your Brand’s Credibility And Trustworthiness</h6>
      <p class="text-justify">Influencers' content and suggestions are trusted by consumers since they are considered as a third-party, unbiased source, and this might influence people buying your items or services. Influencers' most powerful weapon is their followers' faith in their judgement. Collaborating with credible and relevant influencers will help you build your brand's reputation and credibility. As a result, when they express their thoughts on your brand, it will be perceived as a genuine endorsement, which will help you establish a loyal following of brand supporters.</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Aids In Content Strategy Revamping</h6>
      <p class="text-justify">If you're dealing with influencers, creating content for and about your followers is a developing trend that you should take advantage of. This type of content is the reason that 31% of marketers use influencer marketing, according to research by Influencer Marketing Hub. The perceived value of user-generated content (UGC) is increasing over time and incorporating influencer-created material into your feed may be quite advantageous because they provide the perfect testimonial that you can publish on your own channels.</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Helps you boost Engagement</h6>
      <p class="text-justify">It might be difficult to increase the amount of likes, comments, and shares on social media posts, especially if your company is new to the market. Working with influencers may help you develop some very interesting and original content, which can enhance interaction on your social media channels. When influencers post content about your company on their pages, their followers will engage with it, and they may then engage with you if they believe an influencer they like loves your items as well. If you want to run a giveaway, working with influencers is a terrific method to broaden your reach and get more people to participate. According to a 2017 poll of over 100,000 influencers, the more followers you have, the lower your engagement rate becomes, which is why micro-influencers are on the increase and shouldn't be neglected.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Other than all these benefits of incorporating influencer marketing in your strategy it can also help you improve your search engine rankings by expanding your reach. If an influencer posts a direct link to your website on their blog, it is likely to increase traffic to your site and, as a result, improve your internet rankings and if you’re aiming for more sales, giving out affiliate codes or tracking links is an easy way of seeing how much is being generated from influencers. </p>
