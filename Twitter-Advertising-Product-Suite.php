      <!--<h1 class="poppins-semibold mb-5">Twitter’s Advertising Product Suite- Recategorized & Rebranded</h1>-->
      <img src="images/twitterBlog.jpeg" alt="Great Taglines" class="responsive-img">
      <p class="text-justify">Twitter advertising is an opportunity for a brand to promote their products and reach new users who might be interested in what a brand offers, and recently with an effort to provide more clarity around its various ad offerings and with an idea to make it much easier for brands to find the right promotional options. Twitter has announced a re-branding of its ad products, which essentially streamlines its different options into fewer, grouped segments.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">As explained by Twitter: "After an extensive discovery and research process, we have recategorized and rebranded our entire ad suite. We have gone from 22+ individual ad format names to just 5 advertising categories with a corresponding suite of features that can be applied across them."</p>
      <p class="text-justify">This re-branding of ads on twitter only aims for clarity, as we see that it doesn’t provide any new ad options or other super-advanced promotional tools.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">The new Twitter ad categories are-</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="poppins-semibold">Promoted Ads:</span> These formats can feature images, videos, and various ad features. They can be used in multiple ways across each stage of the marketing funnel.</li>
        <li><span class="poppins-semibold">Follower Ads:</span> This format can be used to promote an account to a targeted audience to build awareness and attract new followers.</li>
        <li><span class="poppins-semibold">Twitter Amplify:</span> With Twitter Amplify advertisers can align their ads with premium video content from the most relevant publishers. </li>
        <li><span class="poppins-semibold">Twitter Takeover:</span> This category includes the most premium, mass-reach placements that drive results across the funnel by taking over the Timeline and Explore tab.</li>
        <li><span class="poppins-semibold">Twitter Live:</span> With Twitter Live, advertisers can broadcast their biggest moments to the world, and allow an audience to join in real-time.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-justify">The simplification makes it much easier to remember all the options available for Twitter ad. This clarity on what twitter offers in each category, makes it easier for advertisers to understand the best available options on how to reach the twitter audience and for their overall approach as a brand.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">The update also includes a revamped experience of setting up with a pre-roll ad campaigns along with the launch of the tool, the basic objective is to make publisher pairing selection easier and more intuitive. Advertisers will now have the access to full library of publisher’s content category offerings.</p>
