      <img src="images/taglineBlog.jpeg" alt="Great Taglines" class="responsive-img">
      <p class="text-justify">Taglines are all about brand communication that has the Campaign</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Taglines are the brand’s elevator pitch and help people get a snapshot of what the brand is all about. The great taglines basically become synonymous with brand and sum it up perfectly by inspiring the customers and attaching them well to the brand.

      <p class="text-justify">Taglines are the brand’s elevator pitch and help people get a snapshot of what the brand is all about. The great taglines basically become synonymous with brand and sum it up perfectly by inspiring the customers and attaching them well to the brand. This is exactly what great taglines are supposed to do. They make you think, feel, relate with the brand, connect with its vision, trust it and remember it for years to come.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">There are a few pointers which we should keep in mind before creating a tagline like: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Keep it short and on point. Taglines should never be longer than a sentence as anything longer is ultimately forgettable. Always stick to a brief catchy line.</li>
        <li>Highlighting a key benefit that your brand has an advantage over your competitors can help in creating a unique tagline by integrating it with the tagline.</li>
        <li>Evoking an emotional response based on the brands target audience through taglines helps in connecting with the audience and making them think about themselves rather than the brand hence brings appreciation for the product as well as brand.</li>
        <li>Always show the happy part in the tagline as focusing on positive part makes the audience happy and they feel more connected.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-justify">So now the question is what makes these taglines truly inspirational? With these few great taglines mentioned below we can definitely figure that out.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Timex – Takes A Licking And Keeps On Ticking</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-justify">This is undoubtedly one of the best taglines of companies that sell watches. Timex came up with it in 1956, after series of live dramatic spots putting Timex watches to the torture tests. The watches survived tests against paint mixers, jackhammers, washing machines, dishwashers, water skiers and even an 87-foot dive off, after every test, they reiterated the Timex slogan which is so creative and goes with what exactly they wanted to portray.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>M&M’s – Melts In Your Mouth, Not In Your Hands</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-justify">Coined in 1930’s for the first time, this tagline was created by Forrest Mars himself to highlight the main distinguishing factor of these candies. It also subtly hints that M&Ms are so delicious that they will not stay in your hands for long anyway!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
      Red Bull – It Gives You Wings
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-justify">Coined in 1997, This slogan is still widely used all over the world for the brand. Well, it's obviously smart advertising. It states that it gives you wings but it is really a metaphor, if you will, of the fact that it gives you the energy to tackle anything. Meaning that any task that you attempt will be much easier since you feel like you have wings. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Taco Bell – Think Outside the Bun </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-justify">Originally coined in the 2000s, this slogan is quite a popular and different, The Taco Bell slogan is a play on the phrase "think outside the box," which essentially means to be creative and think differently than the norm. Now, as a fast-food restaurant, the majority of Taco Bell's competition comes from other fast-food restaurants that are generally known for serving hamburgers (McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.). So, Taco Bell urges you to "think outside the (hamburger) bun" and try some of their coveted Tex-Mex cuisine.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Snickers – You Are Not You, When You Are Hungry </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-justify">In 2010 this slogan for Snickers was created and this ad campaign gained popularity when they showed celebrities turning into different people as a result of hunger. This actually helped the brand to immensely gain profit and people literally started using snickers as a snack when hunger strikes.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Surf excel – Daag Acche Hai</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">The most admirable thing about this simple yet curious tagline is, it helped people see stains in a whole new light. The brand very creatively mentions that while kids are having fun and their clothes are getting dirty they are simultaneously learning  a lot.</p>
<ol>

<li>Kitkat – Have A Break. Have A Kitkat</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">This very familiar tagline was first used in 1957, but continues to convey the brand message cleverly and simply. It stands out from competitors by focusing on how you should take breaks from your busy schedule and enjoy them, instead of talking about the crisp wafer or chocolate coating.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mentos – Dimaag Ki Batti Jala De</li>
</ol>

  <p class="text-justify">This mint brand gained a competitive edge through a unique and fun tagline. It focuses on how Mentos helps you think better and smarter and handle tricky situations! And thanks to some cool ads, the slogan works even without any scientific proof to support its claim.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dollar Shave Club – Shave Time. Shave Money</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">This Catchy slogan talks about convenience and Cost. These two service benefits suffice the need of the brand and represents the overall tone of the brand perfectly. This tagline talks perfectly about the brand’s expertise.
