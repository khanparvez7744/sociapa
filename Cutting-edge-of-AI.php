      <p class="text-justify">Netflix, the world’s leading content streaming service, needs little introduction. However, not many people know that a great deal of its unstoppable success is a result of cutting-edge AI.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Starbucks is no exception.To offer its audience an additional layer of consumer value, the coffee colossus integrated its most subscribed apps, with Amazon’s Alexa technology. In doing so, its customers now use their own ‘My Starbucks Barista’ service to place and modify orders, as well as confirm a pickup location for maximum convenience – undoubtedly a seamless blend of voice and chatbot innovation in action.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Because of the success of its 'My Starbucks Barista' application, the brand has widened its AI advancements by adding AI-controlled Mastrena II coffee creators (machines that basically supplement the pre-requesting abilities of the application) to large number of its outlets, to offer a more reliable and smooth espresso making experience to its customers.</p>
      <h6 class="poppins-semibold">Alibaba Opens a FashionAI Store</h6>

According to a National Retail Federation survey, 80% of shoppers say retail technologies and innovations have enhanced their online buying experience, while 66% say the same about brick-and-mortar retail.</p>
